    <center><h3><b>Family Background</b></h3></center>
    <img class="imeji" src = "fam.jpg" alt="" img width = "70%"/>
    <p>My family is composed of 3 female homo-sapiens, my grandmother, my mother and my younger sister, and 3 male homo-sapiens, my father, my youngest brother, and me. Both my parents are working their butt for our sake.<p/>
    
  <center><h3><b>Hobbies</b></h3></center>
  <img class="imeji"src = "intra.jpg" alt="" img width  ="70%" />
    <p> With all honesty, I am a master expert in intrapersonal communication.
    I talk to myself whatever the situation is, but ofcourse only I can hear what's going on. Not to mention I also like beatboxing.
    <p/>
 <center><h3><b>Strengths and Weaknesses in I.T field</b></h3></center>
  <img class="imeji" src = "comlab.jpg" alt = "" img width = "70%" />
    <p>I am somewhat confident with my skills in handling computer hardware rather than software. It is and will always be my joy when the LAN tester's light indicators were all turned on when I am creating a LAN cable for computer connection. Although I also love the thrill of programming, but I'm not that fond with it.  <p/>
    
    
  <center><h3><b>Skills and Talents</b></h3></center>
  <img class="imeji" src = "result.jpg" alt = "" img width = "70%" img height = "70%"/>
    <p>I am recognized by TESDA as competent in Computer System Servicing NC II. Although I still need a lot of practice to make full use of this ability I learned. <p/>
